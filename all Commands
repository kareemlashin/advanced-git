git init

git status	
This command lists all the files that have to be committed.
This command returns the current state of the repository.
The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 
List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:	


git rm -r [file-name.txt]	

git branch	

git branch [branch name]	

git checkout [branch name]	

git merge [branch name]	

git stash	
This command temporarily stores all the modified tracked files.
To save changes made when they’re not in a state to commit them to a repository. 
This will store the work and give a clean working directory.
For instance, when working on a new feature that’s not complete, but an urgent bug needs attention.


git diff
This command shows the file differences which are not yet staged.

git reset [file]
This command unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents.
